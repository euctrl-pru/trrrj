\title{Extract level segment from a list of position reports.}
\usage{
extract_segment(prs, vert_limit = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{prs}{dataset containing position reports.
Two variables are used: `timestamp` and `altitude` (feet)}

\item{vert_limit}{the maximum absolute vertical rate for a segment to be
considered level (default = 5 feet/s)}

\value{
a dataset of level segments. A level segment is defined by

\description{
It is assumed that the dataset is grouped by flight id
and that position reports are sorted by timestamp.
