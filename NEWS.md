# trrrj 0.0.1


## Initial Release

I am very please to announce the first release of trrrj.
This is the first small step towards a reusable set of functionality to analyse flight trajectories.

This first version brings a simple workflow together: from loading
([Flightradar24][fr24]/[NM][cfmu-nm])
flights and relevant position reports to some basic plotting.
